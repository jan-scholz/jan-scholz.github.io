  "articleBody": "Remember the 1970s Have you heard the news? We are developing supersonic planes again! Just like it’s 19761. Soon we’ll go to the moon, something we haven’t done since 19722. The French high-speed train (TGV) achieved its record of 318 km/h in 19723 while today’s North American high-speed trains barely reach (240 km/h4,5).\nWhat happened? How did we abandon the pursuit of moon-shot ideas (quite literally)?\nIt can’t be a coincidence that ambitious projects, such as moon missions, supersonic planes, and high-speed trains, appeared in a brief 20-year window after the end of the Second World War and then got scaled back or vanished in the 70s and 80s when Western economies and Japan stopped growing rapidly.\nDecade US (%) France (%) Japan (%) 1960s 4.7 5.7 10.4 1970s 3.2 4.1 4.5 1980s 3.1 2.4 4.3 1990s 3.2 2.0 1.5 2000s 1.9 1.5 0.5 2010s 2.3 1.4 1.2 2020s 1.7 0.4 -0.2 Table 1: GDP growth rates for the US, France, and Japan6.\nThe Apollo moon landing program didn’t come cheap. At its peak, NASA’s budget reached approximately 4.4% of the federal budget in 1966. No civil national endeavor has ever received that much funding since7. These kinds of expenditures are certainly easier to shoulder during times of economic growth.\nThe slowing of Wester economies has been attributed to globalization, financialization, and fiscal politics8.\nDid the economic deceleration lead to the abandonment of national endeavours? Or was the abandonment of national endeavours a sign of a wholly different phenomenon. More pointedly, did we loose the ability to run ambitious, large-scale engineering projects after the 1970s?\nI suspect that this idea might not be entirely foreign to the software engineers among my readers. It feels like building digital infrastructure should be much easier than sending people to the moon; yet in many cases we’ve made this activity slower and more complex than assembling a Saturn V.\nDid we lose touch with our work? Anyone who has worked on building large-scale software applications must have thought:\nHow in the world did these guys and gals deliver these massively complex projects in the 70s!?\nClearly, something changed. We came out of this period of remarkable engineering endeavours unable to deploy a simple website9.\nA woman wiring sense lines in a core rope. She is threading the wire through a white circular aperture that indicates the core to wire. (Copyright: Smithsonian Institution)\nDid we (literally) lose touch with our work? Programming a computer in the 60s consisted of physically weaving software into high-density storage10 and perforating punched cards with hand-operated keypunch devices. This required a level of intimacy with tools that the modern workplace lacks. Perhaps the popularity of mechanical keyboards amongst developers is an expression of the desire to connect physically with their work.\nSimilarly, digital tools operate in a space untethered from physical constraints. A Jira board can grow without limits. An email doesn’t cost anything and is delivered instantaneously. As a consequence, developers drown in work caused by task management tools and get distracted by noisy communication channels.\nThe fact that most work nowadays takes place in an infinite, digital space has allowed bureaucratic overhead – commonly referred to as “process” – to grow unchecked.\nA lot of activities are seen as free, presumably because they don’t rely on raw material and the people engaging in them don’t break out in sweat. It only takes a few clicks to track your tasks on Jira. A video call with the team is set up just as easily. A compliance form can be sent to the whole company via email.\nA Kanban board in the 1970s. (Credit: Tom Kelley Archive, License type: Royalty-free)\nCompare that to the effort needed to update a physical task scheduling board in the photo at the top of this post. Cue cards need to be filled out with pens and inserted in the right slot. The effort of updating the task board is visible and obvious.\nThe physicality of the workspace in the pre-digital era also limited “noise”. Asking a division to fill in a compliance form would have required printing and mailing a copy to everyone and then collecting it afterward.\nIn contrast, today, any random person can email a form or survey to hundreds of people with the clicks of a few buttons. The fact that a few hundred people are now distracted from their core activity is invisible to the sender. Even worse, these emails often lack context, attachments and links don’t work, and the list of recipients includes people who the ask doesn’t apply to.\nThis noise is the bane of the modern working environment overwhelming employees with distractions and preventing focus and deep work.\nBlurred responsibilities This post’s header photo illustrates another phenomenon: Digital activities have become the responsibility of everyone. Instead of assigning dedicated personnel, everyone is now expected to be able to carry out any task, because they all require clicking on an app, which anyone should be able to do, right?\nThe plethora of digital tools, that are making everything so easy that anyone can do it, has lead to a blurring of responsibilities. Developers are now project managers and need to track and schedule work. Managers are now HR and need to post job adverts and schedule interviews. Directors are now accountants and need to keep budget trackers updated and set up invoicing for contractors.\nThe promise that digital tools and automation would save an individual’s time has not come true; similar to how the invention of washing machines has not decreased the time we spend doing laundry. The gains from automating the washing are eaten up by washing cloth more frequently and folding and storing the larger volume of cloth we now own.\nWork carried out in physical space made the distinction between different professions obvious. Now every activity looks the same: a person sitting in front of a computer. This has lead to the logical fallacy of assuming any tasks that requires sitting in front of a computer could be carried out by anyone who can operate a computer. Since most tasks rely on nothing but software applications, everyone should now be able to do any task.\nCut to achieve something that seems just beyond the capacity of the available tools and resources. calculate trajectory corrections with a group of people (computers) in a room with paper and pencil\nTimes changed, how did we get so busy? less ambitious, bogged down in bureaucracy and side-tracked\nIt Takes 6 Days to Change 1 Line of Code\nLarge, collective efforts had suddenly become either unachievable or unaffordable or both.\nBack in the 70s people trusted the process. They set ambitious goals and figured out the challenges on the way.\nNow, people were tripping over themselves to ensure success from the outset.\nThere’s a certain humbleness in this approach. Not everything can be know. Not every bet needs to pay off. If everybody works together, great things will come of it.\nBack to the 1970s We seem to have lost this mindset, especially in the corporate world.\nIn a very strange way, approaches like agile have been trying to recapture the spirit of collaborating in the face of uncertainty.\nThere’s an almost primal quality to situations where humans collaborate effortlessly11. Our Stone Age ancestors worked together to drive large prey into the spears of waiting hunters. This enabled them to achieve a far more stable food supply than had every individual hunter gone out by themselves.\nIn modern times we marvel at soccer players who anticipate each other’s actions and position themselves to support their teammates – again, achieving much more than had each individual tried to take the ball to the opponent’s goal by themselves.\nGreat endeavours like the moon lander, the Concord, and the TGV seem to have been powered by a similar shared understanding between many individuals.\nWork is hierarchically split into achievable, independent pieces. Teams anticipate each other’s move. Teams and individuals develop trust and learn to rely on each other, which reduces communication and coordination overhead. Roles are clear, but also flexible leading to increased resiliency when team composition or demands change.\nThey didn’t fit into a limited transactional view of investments and returns. Nobody could have predicted the advancements in material science and integrated circuits that would come out of the Apollo program. In fact, there was no expectation that specific discoveries would be made.\nof what we are meant to to achieve.\nWe lost our ability to dream?\nTo work outside the strict confines of profitability?\ncost-savings and efficiency squeezing has warped our minds that we don’t even achieve that because we spend too much time on evaluating and blocking things best way to save costs is not to do anything\nThe first commercial flights took place on January 21, 1976. The Concorde fleet was retired from service on October 24, 2003, marking its last flight. wiki ↩︎\nThe last time humans walked on the moon was during the Apollo 17 mission. The third moonwalk, the last of the Apollo program, took place on December 13, 1972. wiki ↩︎\nThe current world speed record for a commercial train on steel wheels is held by the French French Train à Grande Vitesse (TGV) at 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph) wiki ↩︎\nThe fastest train in North America is Amtrak’s Acela Express, which operates along the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. The Acela Express reaches speeds of up to 240 km/h (150 mph) along certain sections of the route, making it the fastest train service in the United States. However, these speeds are achieved on relatively short sections of track. wiki ↩︎\nAnd even in Europe, most high-speed railways remain below 300 km/h to this day. See High-speed rail in Europe. ↩︎\nWorld Bank GDP growth (annual %) - Japan ↩︎\nFor comparison, the Large Hadron Collider is estimated to have cost about $9 billion USD. This cost was distributed across CERN’s 23 member states over many years. With most European countries revenues and expenditures in the hundreds of billions, this amounts to less than a tenth of a percent of a country’s budget. ↩︎\n… and the 1973 oil crisis, the end of the Bretton Woods System, the Nixon shock, inflation, stagflation, etc. (see, e.g. Then and Now: The Crisis of the 1970s and the Upheaval of the 2020s) ↩︎\nHealthcare.gov was officially launched in 2013 to allow US residents in 36 states to manage their own healthcare exchange. High website demand caused the website to go down within 2 hours of the launch. Many more issues resulted in the costs to increase from the initial $93.7M budget to more than $1.7B.

<p><em>What happened? How did we abandon the pursuit of moon-shot ideas (quite literally)?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be a coincidence that ambitious projects, such as moon missions, supersonic planes, and high-speed trains, appeared in a brief 20-year window after the end of the Second World War and then got scaled back or vanished in the 70s and 80s when Western economies and Japan stopped growing rapidly.</p>

<p><strong>Table 1:</strong> <em>GDP growth rates for the US, France, and Japan<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</em></p>
<p>The Apollo moon landing program didn&rsquo;t come cheap. At its peak, NASA&rsquo;s budget reached approximately 4.4% of the federal budget in 1966. No civil national endeavor has ever received that much funding since<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. These kinds of expenditures are certainly easier to shoulder during times of economic growth.</p>
<p>The slowing of Wester economies has been attributed to globalization, financialization, and fiscal politics<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Did the economic deceleration lead to the abandonment of national endeavours? Or was the abandonment of national endeavours a sign of a wholly different phenomenon. More pointedly, did we loose the ability to run ambitious, large-scale engineering projects after the 1970s?</p>
<!-- However, cause and effect are not easy to distinguish here. Were these measures implemented to prevent economic stagnation or did they cause it? -->
<p>I suspect that this idea might not be entirely foreign to the software engineers among my readers. It feels like building digital infrastructure should be much easier than sending people to the moon; yet in many cases we&rsquo;ve made this activity slower and more complex than assembling a Saturn V.</p>
<h1 id="did-we-lose-touch-with-our-work">Did we lose touch with our work?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#did-we-lose-touch-with-our-work">#</a></h1>
<p>Anyone who has worked on building large-scale software applications must have thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How in the world did these guys and gals deliver these massively complex projects in the 70s!?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, something changed. We came out of this period of remarkable engineering endeavours unable to deploy a simple website<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Did we (literally) lose touch with our work? Programming a computer in the 60s consisted of physically weaving software into high-density storage<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and perforating punched cards with hand-operated keypunch devices. This required a level of intimacy with tools that the modern workplace lacks. Perhaps the popularity of mechanical keyboards amongst developers is an expression of the desire to connect physically with their work.</p>
<p>Similarly, digital tools operate in a space untethered from physical constraints. A Jira board can grow without limits. An email doesn&rsquo;t cost anything and is delivered instantaneously. As a consequence, developers drown in work caused by task management tools and get distracted by noisy communication channels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The fact that most work nowadays takes place in an infinite, digital space has allowed bureaucratic overhead &ndash; commonly referred to as &ldquo;process&rdquo; &ndash; to grow unchecked.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of activities are seen as free, presumably because they don&rsquo;t rely on raw material and the people engaging in them don&rsquo;t break out in sweat. It only takes a few clicks to track your tasks on Jira. A video call with the team is set up just as easily. A compliance form can be sent to the whole company via email.</p>

<p>Compare that to the effort needed to update a physical task scheduling board in the photo at the top of this post. Cue cards need to be filled out with pens and inserted in the right slot. The effort of updating the task board is visible and obvious.</p>
<p>The physicality of the workspace in the pre-digital era also limited &ldquo;noise&rdquo;. Asking a division to fill in a compliance form would have required printing and mailing a copy to everyone and then collecting it afterward.</p>
<p>In contrast, today, any random person can email a form or survey to hundreds of people with the clicks of a few buttons. The fact that a few hundred people are now distracted from their core activity is invisible to the sender. Even worse, these emails often lack context, attachments and links don&rsquo;t work, and the list of recipients includes people who the ask doesn&rsquo;t apply to.</p>
<p>This noise is the bane of the modern working environment overwhelming employees with distractions and preventing focus and deep work.</p>
<h1 id="blurred-responsibilities">Blurred responsibilities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#blurred-responsibilities">#</a></h1>
<p>This post&rsquo;s header photo illustrates another phenomenon: Digital activities have become the responsibility of everyone. Instead of assigning dedicated personnel, everyone is now expected to be able to carry out any task, because they all require clicking on an app, which anyone should be able to do, right?</p>
<p>The plethora of digital tools, that are making everything so easy that anyone can do it, has lead to a blurring of responsibilities. Developers are now project managers and need to track and schedule work. Managers are now HR and need to post job adverts and schedule interviews. Directors are now accountants and need to keep budget trackers updated and set up invoicing for contractors.</p>
<p>The promise that digital tools and automation would save an individual&rsquo;s time has not come true; similar to how the invention of washing machines has not decreased the time we spend doing laundry. The gains from automating the washing are eaten up by washing cloth more frequently and folding and storing the larger volume of cloth we now own.</p>
<p>Work carried out in physical space made the distinction between different professions obvious. Now every activity looks the same: a person sitting in front of a computer. This has lead to the logical fallacy of assuming any tasks that requires sitting in front of a computer could be carried out by anyone who can operate a computer. Since most tasks rely on nothing but software applications, everyone should now be able to do any task.</p>
<h1 id="cut">Cut<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cut">#</a></h1>
<p>to achieve something that seems just beyond the capacity of the available tools and resources. calculate trajectory corrections with a group of people (computers) in a room with paper and pencil</p>
<p>Times changed, how did we get so busy? less ambitious, bogged down in bureaucracy and side-tracked</p>
<p><a href="https://edw519.posthaven.com/it-takes-6-days-to-change-1-line-of-code">It Takes 6 Days to Change 1 Line of Code</a></p>
<p>Large, collective efforts had suddenly become either unachievable or unaffordable or both.</p>
<p>Back in the 70s people trusted the process. They set ambitious goals and figured out the challenges on the way.</p>
<p>Now, people were tripping over themselves to ensure success from the outset.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain humbleness in this approach. Not everything can be know. Not every bet needs to pay off. If everybody works together, great things will come of it.</p>
<h1 id="back-to-the-1970s">Back to the 1970s<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#back-to-the-1970s">#</a></h1>
<p>We seem to have lost this mindset, especially in the corporate world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In a very strange way, approaches like agile have been trying to recapture the spirit of collaborating in the face of uncertainty.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s an almost primal quality to situations where humans collaborate effortlessly<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Our Stone Age ancestors worked together to drive large prey into the spears of waiting hunters. This enabled them to achieve a far more stable food supply than had every individual hunter gone out by themselves.</p>
<p>In modern times we marvel at soccer players who anticipate each other&rsquo;s actions and position themselves to support their teammates &ndash; again, achieving much more than had each individual tried to take the ball to the opponent&rsquo;s goal by themselves.</p>
<p>Great endeavours like the moon lander, the Concord, and the TGV seem to have been powered by a similar shared understanding between many individuals.</p>
<p>Work is hierarchically split into achievable, independent pieces. Teams anticipate each other&rsquo;s move. Teams and individuals develop trust and learn to rely on each other, which reduces communication and coordination overhead.
Roles are clear, but also flexible leading to increased resiliency when team composition or demands change.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t fit into a limited transactional view of investments and returns. Nobody could have predicted the advancements in material science and integrated circuits that would come out of the Apollo program. In fact, there was no expectation that specific discoveries would be made.</p>
<p>of what we are meant to to achieve.</p>
<p>We lost our ability to dream?</p>
<p>To work outside the strict confines of profitability?</p>
<p>cost-savings and efficiency squeezing has warped our minds that we don’t even achieve that
because we spend too much time on evaluating and blocking things
best way to save costs is not to do anything</p>
