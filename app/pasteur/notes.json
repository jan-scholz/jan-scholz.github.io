    "year": "300s BCE",

    "name": "Francesco Redi",
    "year": "1668",
    "notes": "Did not believe in spontaneous generation. Experiment: Put meat in jars — some open, some covered with gauze, some sealed. Result: Maggots only appeared on meat that flies could reach, showing that only flies make flies."

    "name": "John Needham",
    "year": "1745",
    "notes": "Believed in spontaneous generation for microorganisms. Experiment: Boiled beef broth, then covered it. Microbes still grew. Conclusion (wrong): Thought heating killed everything, so life must have come from the broth itself."

    "name": "Lazzaro Spallanzani",
    "year": "1765",
    "notes": "Did not believe in spontaneous generation. Repeated Needham’s experiment but boiled the broth longer and sealed the containers tightly. Result: No microorganisms grew, showing that life comes from existing life, not from broth."

    "name": "Louis Pasteur",
    "year": "1861",
    "notes": "Did not believe in spontaneous generation. Experiment: Used swan-neck (S-shaped) flasks with broth. Air could enter, but dust and microbes were trapped in the curve. Result: No microbial growth unless the flask was tipped, proving that microorganisms come from the environment, not from nonliving matter."
